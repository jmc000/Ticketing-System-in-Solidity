# Ticketing System on Ethereum

The goal of this project is to design a ticketing system allowing an artist to sell their tickets directly to their audience.
This solution is coded in Solidity in order to be deployed on EVM.<br>
There is only the back-end part here, including the Solidity smart contracts and the javascript test files.

## Smart Contract Testing

Test files verify the security of our ticketing system.<br>
You can run smart contracts test using truffle test.

```python
truffle test
```

Here is the result you should have:
